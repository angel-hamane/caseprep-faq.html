  <h1>Probate Case Prep – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p class="sub">This course helps you organize facts, evidence, and strategy inputs so you’re ready for court or a lawyer consult. It is <strong>not</strong> petition drafting or legal advice.</p>

  <!-- About the Course -->
  <details>
    <summary>What is Probate Case Prep? How is it different from your petition course?</summary>
    <p>Case Prep is pre-petition work: understanding process, identifying legal grounds, and assembling a clean case binder (timeline, documents, witness notes). The flagship petition course focuses on drafting and filing documents. Many students take Case Prep first to save time and money later.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Who is this for?</summary>
    <p>For people considering probate litigation in California who want to clarify if they have a case and organize evidence before meeting an attorney or filing pro per.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What will I have by the end?</summary>
    <p>A structured case binder: a dated timeline, organized records (medical/financial where relevant), a list of potential witnesses, and a map of possible legal grounds tied to supporting evidence.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Scope & Limits -->
  <details>
    <summary>Do you tell me exactly what to file or how to word my petition?</summary>
    <p>No. This course is educational and focuses on preparation and organization, not drafting filings. For legal advice or document drafting, consult a licensed probate attorney or enroll in the separate petition course when available.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you review my documents or tell me if I will win?</summary>
    <p>No. I can’t review personal materials or predict outcomes. The course helps you evaluate potential grounds and assemble evidence so a lawyer—or the court—can understand your case more quickly.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will this course cover every county’s procedures?</summary>
    <p>No. Concepts are California-focused, but local rules vary by county. Case Prep teaches how to organize and think through the case; always check your local court’s rules.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Content Focus -->
  <details>
    <summary>What are “grounds,” and will we work on them here?</summary>
    <p>Yes—at a preparation level. We examine common grounds (lack of capacity, undue influence, financial elder abuse, fraud/forgery/duress/mistake/improper execution) and the types of evidence that tend to support each, so you can assess fit and gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will this help me talk to a lawyer more efficiently?</summary>
    <p>That’s the goal. Walking into a consult with a timeline, key records, and clear questions can shorten paid time significantly and improve the quality of advice.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Tech & Access -->
  <details>
    <summary>How long do I have access? Is it self-paced?</summary>
    <p>Self-paced, on-demand. Access terms will be listed on the checkout page at launch.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if the site/videos don’t work on my device?</summary>
    <p>Try a different browser (Chrome/Safari), refresh, disable ad-blockers, or use another device. For platform issues, contact FreshLearn support. I can’t fix your computer, printer, or internet.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Organization & Evidence -->
  <details>
    <summary>What counts as useful evidence for my binder?</summary>
    <p>Depends on the ground, but examples include dated emails/texts, medical records showing decline, financial statements, sudden changes to estate documents, witness notes, and a clean timeline tying events to allegations.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I handle sensitive documents?</summary>
    <p>Redact private numbers when organizing, keep originals secure, and store copies in clearly labeled folders. Follow any protective orders or privacy rules that apply.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Timing & Next Steps -->
  <details>
    <summary>Does this course address deadlines (statute of limitations)?</summary>
    <p>Yes, at a high level so you understand why timing matters. It does not calculate your deadline. If timing is uncertain, consult a probate attorney immediately.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What are my options after I finish?</summary>
    <p>Use your binder to (1) consult a probate attorney, (2) continue learning in the petition course when available, or (3) decide not to proceed. The value is clarity before spending more time or money.</p>
